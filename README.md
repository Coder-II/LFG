# LFG (Latent Factor Generator)
Source Code of "LFG: A Generative Network for Real-Time Recommendation" and DLFG(Dual Latent Factor Generator).

The main python file now is "DLFG.py".

I would update the usage document and the trained weights
when my headache is gone.

And of course, those are complete codes, you can also figure out your own.
